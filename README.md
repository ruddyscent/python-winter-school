## Course Description

You will bulid up a Python environment which can be used for your subsequent researches and course works. I'll try to give you experiences on data manipulation and analysis, visualization, numerical analysis, optimization through 30 hours course. These contents will serve as a alternative (hopefully better) tools of Microsoft® Excel, Mathworks® Matlab, OriginLab® OriginPro, and some part of Wolfram Research Mathematica. All topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples, available at https://github.com/python-winter-school.

This course will handle the following Python packages.
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [ipywidgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Index.ipynb)

This course will handle the following utility programs.
* [Continum Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Prerequisites
* You will need an WiFi-enabled notebook with your favorite OS among Windows, Mac, or Linux.
* Knowledge on programming will be definitely helpful but not required. Those skills will be covered when they are needed.
