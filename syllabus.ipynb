    "\n",
    "You will bulid up a Python environment which can be used for your subsequent researches and course works. I'll try to give you experiences on data manipulation and analysis, visualization, numerical analysis, optimization through 30 hours course. These contents will serve as a alternative (hopefully better) tools of Microsoft速 Excel, Mathworks速 Matlab, OriginLab速 OriginPro, and some parts of Wolfram Research Mathematica速. All topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples, available at https://github.com/python-winter-school.\n",
